# Today's Work Summary - October 15, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Toast Notification Queue System ✅
**Problem**: Registration success toast was hidden by connection toast
**Solution**: Implemented queue-based toast system
- Toasts now queue instead of overlapping
- 3-second display + 0.5-second gap between toasts
- Faster polling (500ms for 5 seconds) after connect button press
- All toasts are now visible in sequence

### 2. BOOT Button as Doorbell Simulator ✅
**Feature**: ESP32-S3 BOOT button (GPIO 0) triggers doorbell
**Implementation**:
- ISR-safe queue-based event handling
- 2-second debounce to prevent double-presses
- Simulates doorbell 1 press
- Perfect for testing without external wiring
- Documented in `docs/BOOT_BUTTON_TESTING.md`

### 3. ISR Safety Audit ✅
**Problem**: System crashes when pressing BOOT button
**Root Causes**:
1. `ESP_LOGI()` called directly in ISR (uses locks)
2. `sip_client_make_call()` called from ISR
3. No debouncing on button presses

**Solutions**:
- Implemented FreeRTOS queue pattern (ISR → Queue → Task)
- All ISR handlers now only send events to queue
- Dedicated task processes events and makes calls
- Added 2-second debounce in task
- Increased task stack from 4KB to 8KB
- Documented in `docs/ISR_SAFETY_AUDIT.md`

### 4. German to English Translation ✅
**Changed**:
- `main/dtmf_decoder.c` - All comments and messages
- `main/gpio_handler.c` - "Interrupt Service installieren"
- `main/main.c` - "WiFi Manager starten", "Web Server starten"
- All code now fully in English

### 5. SIP Call State Management ✅
**Problem**: State not returning to REGISTERED after call
**Solution**:
- Save previous state before call
- Restore state after call simulation
- Doorbell now stays REGISTERED and ready
- Proper state flow: REGISTERED → CALLING → REGISTERED

### 6. SIP Call Implementation Documentation ✅
**Created**: `docs/SIP_CALL_TODO.md`
- Documented current stub implementation
- Listed missing features (RTP, audio, ACK, BYE)
- Explained why full implementation isn't needed yet
- Provided roadmap for future development

### 7. WiFi Stack Stability Improvements ✅
**Problem**: Interrupt watchdog timeout in WiFi stack
**Solutions**:
- Added watchdog to SIP task
- Increased task delay from 200ms to 500ms
- Added `taskYIELD()` to prevent starving WiFi
- Reduced system load

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: ESP_LOGI in ISR Crash
**Error**: `abort() was called at PC 0x40376877 on core 0` in `lock_acquire_generic`
**Fix**: Queue-based deferred work pattern

### Issue 2: Watchdog Timeout on Button Press
**Error**: `Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic'ed (Interrupt wdt timeout on CPU0)`
**Fix**: Debouncing + state check + stack size increase

### Issue 3: Stack Overflow in doorbell_task
**Error**: `A stack overflow in task doorbell_task has been detected`
**Fix**: Increased stack from 4096 to 8192 bytes

### Issue 4: Unhandled Debug Exception
**Error**: `Unhandled debug exception: BREAK instr`
**Fix**: Completed `sip_client_make_call()` function with proper state restore

### Issue 5: WiFi Stack Watchdog Timeout
**Error**: Interrupt watchdog timeout in `ppTask`
**Fix**: Added watchdog, increased delays, added task yield

## Current System Status

### Working Features ✅
- WiFi connection and management
- NTP time synchronization with timezone support
- SIP registration with digest authentication
- Web interface with real-time logging
- Button press detection (physical + BOOT button)
- Debouncing (2-second window)
- Toast notifications (queued)
- Logging with NTP timestamps
- Duplicate log prevention
- State management

### Stub/Incomplete Features ⚠️
- SIP call handling (INVITE created but not sent)
- RTP audio streaming
- Call termination (BYE)
- DTMF sending during calls
- Audio I/O (dummy mode)

### Known Limitations
- No actual SIP calls made (documented as TODO)
- Audio hardware not connected (dummy mode)
- DTMF detection simplified (no real frequency analysis)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Button Testing**
   - Press BOOT button to simulate doorbell
   - Verify 2-second debounce works
   - Check logs show "Doorbell 1 pressed"
   - Confirm state returns to REGISTERED

2. **Registration Testing**
   - Power cycle device
   - Verify auto-registration after 5 seconds
   - Check digest authentication works
   - Confirm 3600-second expiry

3. **Web Interface Testing**
   - Check toast notifications appear in sequence
   - Verify SIP log shows real timestamps
   - Test connect/disconnect buttons
   - Confirm no duplicate log entries

4. **Stability Testing**
   - Leave running for extended period
   - Press button multiple times
   - Monitor for watchdog timeouts
   - Check memory usage

## Next Steps (Future Work)

1. **Full SIP Call Implementation**
   - Send INVITE via socket
   - Handle 100 Trying, 180 Ringing, 200 OK
   - Send ACK to complete handshake
   - Implement BYE for call termination

2. **RTP Audio**
   - Implement RTP sender/receiver
   - Add G.711 codec
   - Connect to I2S audio hardware
   - Handle jitter buffer

3. **Advanced Features**
   - DTMF sending during calls
   - Call history
   - Multiple apartment support
   - NAT traversal (STUN/TURN)

## Performance Metrics

- **Task Stack Sizes**:
  - doorbell_task: 8192 bytes
  - sip_task: 8192 bytes
  
- **Task Priorities**:

  - sip_task: 3
  
- **Polling Intervals**:
  - SIP task: 500ms
  - Status refresh: 10 seconds
  - Log refresh: 500ms (when enabled)

## Code Quality

- ✅ All ISR handlers are ISR-safe
- ✅ No blocking operations in ISRs
- ✅ Proper use of FreeRTOS primitives
- ✅ All code in English
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Logging with timestamps
- ✅ Documentation for all major features

## Conclusion

The doorbell system is now stable and ready for hardware testing. All critical crashes have been fixed, and the system properly handles button presses with debouncing. The SIP registration works reliably, and the web interface provides excellent visibility into system operation.

While full SIP call functionality is not yet implemented, the current stub is sufficient for testing the doorbell hardware, button logic, and system integration. The foundation is solid for future development of complete SIP call handling with RTP audio.
