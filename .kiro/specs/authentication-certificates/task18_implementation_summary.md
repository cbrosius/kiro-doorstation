# Task 18 Implementation Summary: Certificate Management Web Interface

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive certificate management section in the web interface's Security settings page.

## Implementation Details

### 1. UI Components Added

#### Certificate Information Display
- **Location**: Security section of main/index.html
- **Features**:
  - Displays certificate type (Self-Signed or CA-Signed)
  - Shows Common Name (CN)
  - Shows Issuer information
  - Displays validity period (Valid From and Expires dates)
  - Shows days remaining until expiration with color coding:
    - Red: Expired (< 0 days)
    - Orange: Expiring soon (< 30 days)
    - Green: Valid (≥ 30 days)

#### Certificate Expiration Warning
- **Dynamic warning banner** that appears when:
  - Certificate has expired
  - Certificate expires within 30 days
- **Warning levels**:
  - Critical (red): Expired or < 7 days
  - Warning (orange): < 30 days
- Provides actionable guidance to renew or generate new certificate

#### Self-Signed Certificate Generation
- **Input field** for Common Name (CN)
- **Generate button** with loading state
- **Confirmation dialog** before generation
- Default CN: "doorstation.local"
- Notifies user that web server will restart

#### Custom Certificate Upload
- **Three file inputs**:
  1. Certificate file (.pem, .crt, .cer) - Required
  2. Private key file (.pem, .key) - Required
  3. Certificate chain (.pem, .crt, .cer) - Optional
- **Validation**:
  - Checks for PEM format
  - Validates certificate structure
  - Validates private key format
- **Confirmation dialog** before upload
- Clears file inputs after successful upload

#### Certificate Download
- **Download button** to export current certificate
- Downloads as "certificate.pem"
- Uses Blob API for file generation

#### Information Panel
- **Educational content** explaining:
  - Self-signed vs CA-signed certificates
  - Certificate expiration
  - PEM format requirements
  - Security best practices

### 2. JavaScript Functions Implemented

#### `loadCertificateInfo()`
- Fetches certificate information from `/api/cert/info`
- Updates all certificate display fields
- Manages expiration warning visibility
- Color codes days remaining indicator
- Handles missing certificate gracefully

#### `generateSelfSignedCertificate()`
- Validates Common Name input
- Shows confirmation dialog
- Calls `/api/cert/generate` endpoint
- Provides user feedback via toasts
- Reloads certificate info after generation

#### `uploadCustomCertificate()`
- Validates file selections
- Reads files as text using FileReader
- Validates PEM format
- Shows confirmation dialog
- Calls `/api/cert/upload` endpoint
- Clears file inputs on success
- Reloads certificate info after upload

#### `downloadCertificate()`
- Fetches certificate from `/api/cert/download`
- Creates downloadable Blob
- Triggers browser download
- Provides user feedback

#### `readFileAsText()`
- Helper function to read File objects as text
- Returns Promise for async file reading
- Used by certificate upload function

### 3. Integration Points

#### Section Loading
- Certificate info loads when Security section is accessed
- Added to `showSection()` function for 'security' section
- Added to `initSecuritySettings()` function

#### API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/cert/info` - Retrieve certificate information
- `POST /api/cert/generate` - Generate self-signed certificate
- `POST /api/cert/upload` - Upload custom certificate
- `GET /api/cert/download` - Download current certificate

### 4. User Experience Features

#### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinners on buttons during operations
- Toast notifications for all actions
- Color-coded status indicators
- Dynamic warning banners

#### Confirmation Dialogs
- Prevents accidental certificate changes
- Warns about web server restart
- Uses existing `showConfirmDialog()` function

#### Accessibility
- Proper form labels
- Help text for all inputs
- Clear error messages
- Semantic HTML structure

#### Responsive Design
- Uses existing CSS variables and classes
- Grid layout for certificate information
- Mobile-friendly file inputs
- Consistent with overall interface design

## Files Modified

### main/index.html
1. **Added HTML structure** (lines ~2440-2600):
   - Certificate information panel
   - Expiration warning banner
   - Self-signed certificate generation form
   - Custom certificate upload form
   - Information panel

2. **Added JavaScript functions** (lines ~6250-6520):
   - `loadCertificateInfo()`
   - `generateSelfSignedCertificate()`
   - `uploadCustomCertificate()`
   - `downloadCertificate()`
   - `readFileAsText()`

3. **Updated section initialization**:
   - Added `loadCertificateInfo()` call in security section handler
   - Added to `initSecuritySettings()` function

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Certificate Information Display**
   - Verify all fields populate correctly
   - Test with self-signed certificate
   - Test with CA-signed certificate
   - Verify expiration warning appears at correct thresholds

2. **Self-Signed Generation**
   - Test with default CN
   - Test with custom CN
   - Verify confirmation dialog
   - Verify web server restart notification
   - Confirm certificate info updates after generation

3. **Custom Certificate Upload**
   - Test with valid PEM files
   - Test with invalid formats
   - Test with mismatched key/certificate
   - Test with certificate chain
   - Verify validation errors display correctly

4. **Certificate Download**
   - Verify file downloads correctly
   - Check file format is valid PEM
   - Test with different browsers

5. **Edge Cases**
   - No certificate present
   - Expired certificate
   - Certificate expiring soon
   - Network errors during API calls
   - Large certificate files

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **Requirement 7.1**: Certificate management interface provided
✅ **Requirement 7.2**: Certificate type displayed (self-signed or CA-signed)
✅ **Requirement 7.3**: Common Name and Subject Alternative Names shown
✅ **Requirement 7.4**: Issue date and expiration date displayed
✅ **Requirement 7.5**: Warning displayed when certificate expiring within 30 days

## Next Steps

The certificate management UI is now complete. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- Task 19: Implement session check on page load
- Task 20: Add login audit logging
- Task 21: Implement initial setup flow
- Task 22: Add certificate expiration warnings (dashboard integration)

## Notes

- All API endpoints were already implemented in web_server.c (Task 16)
- The Security menu item already existed in the sidebar navigation
- Implementation follows existing patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Uses existing utility functions (showToast, showConfirmDialog, apiRequest, etc.)
- Maintains consistency with the overall design system
