# Task 9 Implementation Summary: Custom Certificate Upload

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive certificate validation and upload functionality with support for certificate chains and integrity validation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced `cert_validate()` Function
**Location:** `main/cert_manager.c`

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ PEM format validation (checks for proper PEM headers)
- ✅ Certificate parsing using mbedtls X.509 parser
- ✅ Certificate expiration validation (checks both expired and not-yet-valid)
- ✅ Private key parsing and validation
- ✅ Key type matching (RSA, EC/ECDSA)
- ✅ RSA key verification (compares modulus N between certificate and private key)
- ✅ EC key verification (compares public key points)
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging with specific failure reasons

**Validation Steps:**
1. Null and empty string checks
2. PEM header verification
3. Certificate parsing with mbedtls
4. Validity period checks (not expired, not future-dated)
5. Private key parsing
6. Key type matching
7. Cryptographic key pair verification (DER public key comparison)

### 2. New `validate_certificate_chain()` Function
**Location:** `main/cert_manager.c` (static helper function)

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Certificate chain parsing
- ✅ Chain integrity validation using mbedtls_x509_crt_verify()
- ✅ Detailed validation failure reporting (expired, revoked, CN mismatch, not trusted)
- ✅ Graceful handling when no chain is provided

**Validation Flags Checked:**
- MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_EXPIRED
- MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_REVOKED
- MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_CN_MISMATCH
- MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_NOT_TRUSTED

### 3. Enhanced `cert_upload_custom()` Function
**Location:** `main/cert_manager.c`

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Certificate and key validation before storage
- ✅ Size limit checks for certificate, key, and chain
- ✅ Certificate chain validation when provided
- ✅ PEM header validation for chain
- ✅ Chain integrity verification
- ✅ Storage of certificate, key, and chain in NVS
- ✅ Proper cleanup of existing chain when none provided
- ✅ Timestamp and metadata storage
- ✅ Comprehensive logging at each step

**Storage Flow:**
1. Validate certificate and key
2. Check size limits
3. Validate chain if provided (format + integrity)
4. Store certificate in NVS
5. Store private key in NVS
6. Store chain in NVS (or clear if not provided)
7. Store metadata (self-signed flag = 0, timestamp)
8. Commit to NVS

## Requirements Coverage

### Requirement 6.2: Certificate Format Validation
✅ Implemented PEM format validation with header checks and mbedtls parsing

### Requirement 6.3: Private Key Verification
✅ Implemented cryptographic verification that private key matches certificate public key
- Uses DER public key comparison (API-version independent)
- Exports public key from certificate and private key as DER format
- Compares byte-by-byte to verify they match
- Works for all key types (RSA, EC, etc.)

### Requirement 6.4: Certificate Storage
✅ Implemented secure storage in NVS with proper error handling

### Requirement 14.1: Certificate Chain Support
✅ Implemented chain parameter in upload function with proper parsing

### Requirement 14.2: Chain Integrity Validation
✅ Implemented chain validation using mbedtls_x509_crt_verify()

### Requirement 14.3: Chain Storage
✅ Implemented chain storage in NVS with size limits and proper cleanup

## Key Technical Details

### mbedtls Functions Used:
- `mbedtls_x509_crt_parse()` - Parse certificates
- `mbedtls_pk_parse_key()` - Parse private keys
- `mbedtls_pk_get_type()` - Get key type
- `mbedtls_pk_write_pubkey_der()` - Export public key as DER
- `mbedtls_x509_crt_verify()` - Verify certificate chain
- `memcmp()` - Compare DER-encoded public keys

### Error Handling:
- Proper cleanup of mbedtls structures
- Detailed error logging with error codes
- Graceful handling of optional parameters (chain)
- NVS transaction safety

### Security Features:
- Validates certificate is not expired
- Validates certificate is not future-dated
- Cryptographically verifies key pair matching
- Validates complete certificate chain
- Checks for revocation and trust issues

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. Upload valid certificate with matching key
2. Upload certificate with mismatched key (should fail)
3. Upload expired certificate (should fail)
4. Upload certificate with valid chain
5. Upload certificate with invalid chain (should fail)
6. Upload certificate without chain (should succeed)

### Edge Cases:
- Empty strings
- NULL pointers
- Oversized certificates/keys/chains
- Invalid PEM format
- Wrong key types
- Future-dated certificates

## Next Steps
This task is complete. The next task (Task 10) will integrate these certificates with the HTTPS web server.
