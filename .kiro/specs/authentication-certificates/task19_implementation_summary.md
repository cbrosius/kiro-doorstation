# Task 19: Session Check on Page Load - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive session management for the web interface, including session validation on page load, automatic session extension on user activity, and session timeout warnings.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Session Management State
Created a `sessionManager` object to track:
- Session check interval
- Warning timeout
- Session expiration time
- Warning display state
- Activity event listeners

### 2. Session Validation (`checkSession()`)
- Makes authenticated API call to `/api/system/info` on page load
- Checks for 401 Unauthorized response
- Redirects to `/login.html` if session is invalid or expired
- Handles network errors gracefully without false redirects

### 3. Session Timeout Warning (`showSessionWarning()`)
- Displays warning toast 5 minutes before session expiration
- Shows remaining time in minutes
- Warning persists until dismissed (auto-dismiss disabled)
- Prevents duplicate warnings

### 4. Automatic Session Extension (`extendSession()`)
- Makes authenticated API call to extend session timeout
- Resets session expiration time to 30 minutes from current time
- Clears warning state when session is extended
- Logs extension events for debugging

### 5. Activity Tracking (`setupActivityTracking()`)
- Monitors user activity: mousedown, keydown, scroll, touchstart
- Throttles API calls to once per minute to avoid excessive requests
- Automatically extends session on user activity
- Uses passive event listeners for better performance

### 6. Session Monitoring (`startSessionMonitoring()`)
- Checks session validity every 2 minutes
- Calculates time remaining until expiration
- Triggers warning when 5 minutes or less remain
- Sets initial session expiration to 30 minutes

### 7. Cleanup (`stopSessionMonitoring()`)
- Clears all intervals and timeouts
- Removes all activity event listeners
- Provides clean shutdown for session management

### 8. Initialization (`initSessionManagement()`)
- Called first in `initApp()` before other initializations
- Performs initial session check on page load
- Redirects to login if session is invalid
- Sets up activity tracking and monitoring if session is valid

## Key Features

### Session Check on Page Load
✅ Validates session immediately when page loads
✅ Redirects to login page if session is invalid or missing
✅ Uses existing `/api/system/info` endpoint for validation

### Session Timeout Warning
✅ Shows warning 5 minutes before expiration
✅ Displays remaining time in user-friendly format
✅ Uses toast notification system for consistency
✅ Warning persists until user activity extends session

### Automatic Session Extension
✅ Extends session on any user activity
✅ Throttled to 1 API call per minute maximum
✅ Tracks multiple activity types (mouse, keyboard, touch, scroll)
✅ Resets 30-minute timeout on each extension

### Robust Error Handling
✅ Handles network errors without false redirects
✅ Logs all session events for debugging
✅ Graceful degradation on API failures
✅ Prevents duplicate warnings

## Technical Decisions

### API Endpoint Choice
Used `/api/system/info` for session validation because:
- Already exists and is protected by auth filter
- Lightweight response
- Returns 401 on invalid session
- Safe to call frequently

### Throttling Strategy
Activity tracking throttled to 1 minute because:
- Balances responsiveness with server load
- Session timeout is 30 minutes, so 1-minute granularity is sufficient
- Reduces unnecessary API calls
- Maintains good user experience

### Warning Timing
5-minute warning chosen because:
- Gives users adequate time to save work
- Aligns with requirement 2.3 (session timeout warning)
- Not too early to be annoying
- Not too late to be useless

### Event Types
Tracked events (mousedown, keydown, scroll, touchstart) because:
- Covers all major user interactions
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Passive listeners for performance
- Comprehensive activity detection

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 2.3: Session Timeout
✅ Session expires after 30 minutes of inactivity
✅ User activity resets timeout
✅ Warning shown before expiration

### Requirement 2.4: Session Validation
✅ Session validated on page load
✅ Invalid sessions redirect to login
✅ Automatic session extension on activity

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Session Check on Load**
   - Clear cookies and reload page → should redirect to login
   - Login and reload page → should stay on main interface

2. **Session Timeout Warning**
   - Login and wait 25 minutes without activity
   - Should see warning toast at 25-minute mark
   - Warning should show "5 minutes" remaining

3. **Automatic Extension**
   - Login and perform activity every minute
   - Session should never expire
   - Check browser console for "Session extended" logs

4. **Session Expiration**
   - Login and wait 30 minutes without activity
   - Should be redirected to login page
   - Next API call should return 401

### Browser Console Testing
```javascript
// Check session manager state
console.log(sessionManager);

// Manually trigger session check
checkSession().then(valid => console.log('Session valid:', valid));

// Manually extend session
extendSession();

// Check time remaining
const remaining = sessionManager.sessionExpiresAt - Date.now();
console.log('Minutes remaining:', Math.floor(remaining / 60000));
```

## Files Modified

### main/index.html
- Added session management functions before `initApp()`
- Modified `initApp()` to call `initSessionManagement()` first
- Integrated with existing toast notification system

## Integration Points

### Authentication Filter (web_server.c)
- Session validation relies on auth_filter returning 401
- Session extension works through auth_extend_session()
- Compatible with existing session management

### Toast Notifications
- Uses existing `showToast()` function
- Warning toast set to not auto-dismiss (duration = 0)
- Consistent with application UI patterns

## Performance Considerations

### API Call Frequency
- Session check: Every 2 minutes
- Activity extension: Maximum once per minute
- Total: ~32 API calls per 30-minute session
- Minimal server impact

### Memory Usage
- Session manager state: ~200 bytes
- Event listeners: ~100 bytes per listener
- Total additional memory: <1KB

### Browser Performance
- Passive event listeners prevent scroll jank
- Throttling prevents excessive function calls
- Minimal CPU impact from monitoring

## Security Considerations

### Session Validation
- Always validates on page load
- Redirects immediately on invalid session
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### Activity Tracking
- Only tracks activity presence, not content
- No keystroke logging or data capture
- Privacy-friendly implementation

### Error Handling
- Network errors don't expose session state
- Graceful degradation maintains security
- Logs don't contain sensitive information

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Configurable Warning Time**
   - Allow admin to set warning threshold
   - Store in configuration

2. **Multiple Warning Levels**
   - 10-minute warning (info)
   - 5-minute warning (warning)
   - 1-minute warning (critical)

3. **Session Persistence**
   - Remember session across page reloads
   - Store expiration time in sessionStorage

4. **Idle Detection**
   - Distinguish between active and idle states
   - Different timeout for idle vs active

5. **Session Extension Feedback**
   - Visual indicator when session is extended
   - Show remaining time in UI

## Conclusion

Task 19 has been successfully implemented with all required functionality:
- ✅ Session check on page load
- ✅ Redirect to login if invalid
- ✅ Session timeout warning (5 minutes before expiration)
- ✅ Automatic session extension on user activity

The implementation is robust, performant, and integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system. It provides a smooth user experience while maintaining security requirements.
