# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication & Certificates feature implements web interface login security and TLS/SSL certificate management for the ESP32 SIP Door Station. This feature protects the web interface from unauthorized access and enables secure HTTPS communication, addressing critical security requirements for production deployments.

## Glossary

- **System**: The ESP32 SIP Door Station authentication and certificate management system
- **Web_Authentication**: Username and password-based login for web interface access
- **Session**: Authenticated user session with timeout
- **TLS_Certificate**: X.509 certificate for HTTPS encryption
- **Certificate_Authority**: Trusted CA for certificate validation
- **Self_Signed_Certificate**: Certificate signed by the device itself
- **HTTPS**: HTTP over TLS/SSL for encrypted communication

5. WHEN certificate is generated, THE System SHALL store certificate and private key in NVS

### Requirement 6: Custom Certificate Upload

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to upload custom TLS certificates, so that I can use certificates signed by trusted Certificate Authorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE admin accesses certificate management, THE System SHALL provide certificate upload interface
2. WHEN admin uploads certificate, THE System SHALL validate certificate format (PEM)
3. WHEN certificate is validated, THE System SHALL verify private key matches certificate
4. WHEN validation succeeds, THE System SHALL store certificate and private key in NVS
5. WHEN certificate is stored, THE System SHALL restart HTTPS server with new certificate

### Requirement 7: Certificate Information Display

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view certificate information, so that I can verify certificate details and expiration date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE admin accesses certificate management, THE System SHALL display current certificate information
2. WHEN certificate info is displayed, THE System SHALL show certificate type (self-signed or CA-signed)
3. WHEN certificate info is displayed, THE System SHALL show Common Name and Subject Alternative Names
4. WHEN certificate info is displayed, THE System SHALL show issue date and expiration date
5. WHEN certificate is expiring within 30 days, THE System SHALL display warning

### Requirement 8: API Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want API endpoints protected by authentication, so that unauthorized clients cannot access device APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE client accesses protected API endpoint, THE System SHALL verify session cookie or API token
2. WHEN authentication is missing, THE System SHALL return 401 Unauthorized status
3. WHEN authentication is invalid, THE System SHALL return 403 Forbidden status
4. WHEN authentication is valid, THE System SHALL process API request
5. WHEN API request completes, THE System SHALL log access with username and timestamp

### Requirement 9: Login Audit Logging

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want login attempt logging, so that I can monitor unauthorized access attempts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE user attempts login, THE System SHALL log attempt with username, timestamp, and IP address
2. WHEN login succeeds, THE System SHALL log successful authentication
3. WHEN login fails, THE System SHALL log failure reason
4. WHEN login is blocked due to rate limiting, THE System SHALL log block event
