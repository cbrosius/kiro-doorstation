# Task 21: Initial Setup Flow - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete initial setup flow that guides users through creating an admin password and generating a self-signed certificate on first boot.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Setup Page (`main/setup.html`)
- **Purpose**: Provides a user-friendly wizard for initial password setup
- **Features**:
  - Clean, modern UI matching the login page design
  - Password strength validation (min 8 chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit)
  - Password confirmation field
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Theme toggle (light/dark mode)
  - Responsive design for mobile devices
  - Clear security requirements display
  - Success/error message handling

### 2. Updated Web Server (`main/web_server.c`)

#### Added Setup Page Handler
```c
static esp_err_t setup_handler(httpd_req_t *req)
```
- Serves the setup.html page
- Redirects to login page if password is already set
- Public endpoint (no authentication required)

#### Modified Authentication Filter
```c
static esp_err_t auth_filter(httpd_req_t *req)
```
- Now redirects to `/setup.html` when no password is set
- Differentiates between API requests (returns 403 JSON) and page requests (redirects)
- Prevents access to protected resources until setup is complete

#### Updated Login Handler
```c
static esp_err_t login_handler(httpd_req_t *req)
```
- Redirects to setup page if password is not set
- Ensures users complete setup before attempting login

#### Updated Index Handler
```c
static esp_err_t index_handler(httpd_req_t *req)
```
- Redirects to setup page if password is not set
- Ensures root path redirects to setup on first boot

#### Enhanced Password Setup Handler
```c
static esp_err_t post_auth_set_password_handler(httpd_req_t *req)
```
- Now generates a self-signed certificate automatically during setup
- Certificate generation is non-blocking (setup succeeds even if cert generation fails)
- Uses default values: CN="doorstation.local", validity=3650 days (10 years)
- Logs certificate generation status

#### Updated Public Endpoints
- Added `/setup.html` to the list of public endpoints
- Ensures setup page is accessible without authentication

#### Added Setup URI Handler
```c
static const httpd_uri_t setup_uri
```
- Registered in `web_server_start()` function
- Maps `/setup.html` to `setup_handler`

### 3. Updated Build Configuration (`main/CMakeLists.txt`)
- Added `setup.html` to embedded binary data
- Ensures setup page is compiled into firmware

## User Flow

### First Boot (No Password Set)
1. User navigates to device IP address
2. Automatically redirected to `/setup.html`
3. User sees setup wizard with password requirements
4. User enters and confirms password
5. Password is validated (strength requirements)
6. Password is set in NVS
7. Self-signed certificate is generated automatically
8. User is redirected to `/login.html`
9. User can now log in with username "admin" and their password

### Subsequent Boots (Password Already Set)
1. User navigates to device IP address
2. If not authenticated, redirected to `/login.html`
3. Setup page is inaccessible (redirects to login)
4. Normal authentication flow proceeds

## Security Features

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one digit (0-9)
- Validated on both client and server side

### Setup Protection
- Setup page only accessible when no password is set
- Once password is set, setup page redirects to login
- API endpoint `/api/auth/set-password` rejects requests if password already exists
- Prevents unauthorized password changes

### Certificate Generation
- Automatically generates self-signed certificate during setup
- Uses secure defaults (2048-bit RSA, 10-year validity)
- Non-blocking (setup succeeds even if cert generation fails)
- Certificate can be regenerated later if needed

## Technical Details

### Password Storage
- Hashed using PBKDF2 with 10,000 iterations
- 16-byte random salt per password
- Stored in NVS namespace "auth"
- Never stored in plaintext

### Certificate Storage
- Generated using mbedtls library
- Stored in NVS namespace "cert"
- Used for HTTPS server on port 443
- Can be replaced with custom certificate later

### Redirect Logic
- HTML page requests: 302 redirect to setup/login page
- API requests: 403 Forbidden with JSON error
- Maintains user experience across different request types

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **First Boot Test**:
   - Flash firmware to device
   - Navigate to device IP
   - Verify redirect to setup page
   - Complete setup with valid password
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Log in with credentials

2. **Password Validation Test**:
   - Try weak passwords (too short, no uppercase, etc.)
   - Verify error messages display correctly
   - Try mismatched passwords
   - Verify validation works

3. **Setup Protection Test**:
   - After setup, try to access `/setup.html`
   - Verify redirect to login page
   - Try to call `/api/auth/set-password` again
   - Verify error response

4. **Certificate Generation Test**:
   - Complete setup
   - Check logs for certificate generation
   - Verify HTTPS works with self-signed cert
   - Check certificate info in web interface

### Edge Cases
- Network interruption during setup
- Browser back button after setup
- Multiple tabs attempting setup
- Setup with very long passwords
- Special characters in passwords

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 3.1
✅ "WHEN THE device is first configured, THE System SHALL require setting admin password"
- Setup wizard enforces password creation on first boot
- No access to main interface without password

### Requirement 5.1
✅ "WHEN THE System first boots without certificate, THE System SHALL generate self-signed certificate"
- Certificate automatically generated during setup
- Uses secure defaults (2048-bit RSA, 10-year validity)

## Files Modified
1. `main/setup.html` - Created new setup wizard page
2. `main/web_server.c` - Added setup handler and modified authentication logic
3. `main/CMakeLists.txt` - Added setup.html to build

## Files Referenced
- `main/auth_manager.h` - Used `auth_is_password_set()` and `auth_set_initial_password()`
- `main/cert_manager.h` - Used `cert_exists()` and `cert_generate_self_signed()`

## Notes
- Setup page uses same styling as login page for consistency
- Theme preference persists across pages using localStorage
- Certificate generation is logged but doesn't block setup completion
- Setup flow is idempotent (safe to retry if interrupted)
- All redirects use 302 Found status code for temporary redirects

## Future Enhancements
- Add option to skip certificate generation during setup
- Allow custom certificate upload during setup
- Add setup progress indicator
- Support for multiple admin users during setup
- Email notification when setup is completed
