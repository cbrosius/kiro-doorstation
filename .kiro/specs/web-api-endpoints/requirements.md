# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing missing web API endpoints in the SIP doorbell system. The web interface currently makes requests to several endpoints that return 404 errors. These endpoints provide configuration management, network information, email notifications, OTA updates, and system information features.

## Glossary

- **Web_Server**: The HTTP server component running on the ESP32-S3 that handles API requests
- **WiFi_Config_Endpoint**: API endpoint for managing WiFi configuration settings
- **Network_IP_Endpoint**: API endpoint for retrieving network IP address information
- **Email_Config_Endpoint**: API endpoint for managing email notification settings
- **OTA_Version_Endpoint**: API endpoint for retrieving and managing firmware version information
- **System_Info_Endpoint**: API endpoint for retrieving comprehensive system information
- **NVS**: Non-Volatile Storage used for persisting configuration data
- **JSON**: JavaScript Object Notation format used for API request/response payloads

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to retrieve and update WiFi configuration through the web interface, so that I can manage network connectivity without physical access to the device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/wifi/config, THE Web_Server SHALL respond with a JSON object containing the current WiFi SSID
2. WHEN a POST request with valid WiFi credentials is sent to /api/wifi/config, THE Web_Server SHALL save the configuration to NVS and respond with a success status
3. IF the POST request to /api/wifi/config contains invalid JSON, THEN THE Web_Server SHALL respond with HTTP 400 status code
4. WHEN WiFi configuration is updated via POST to /api/wifi/config, THE Web_Server SHALL not include the password in any response payload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to retrieve current network IP information through the web interface, so that I can verify network connectivity and configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/network/ip, THE Web_Server SHALL respond with a JSON object containing the current IP address
2. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/network/ip, THE Web_Server SHALL include subnet mask in the response
3. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/network/ip, THE Web_Server SHALL include gateway address in the response
4. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/network/ip, THE Web_Server SHALL include DNS server address in the response
5. IF the device is not connected to WiFi, THEN THE Web_Server SHALL respond with empty or null values for network parameters

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure email notifications through the web interface, so that I can receive alerts about doorbell events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/email/config, THE Web_Server SHALL respond with a JSON object containing email configuration settings
2. WHEN a POST request with valid email settings is sent to /api/email/config, THE Web_Server SHALL save the configuration to NVS
3. WHEN email configuration is retrieved via GET, THE Web_Server SHALL not include the SMTP password in the response
4. WHEN a POST request to /api/email/config contains SMTP server address, THE Web_Server SHALL validate the format before saving
5. IF the POST request to /api/email/config contains invalid JSON, THEN THE Web_Server SHALL respond with HTTP 400 status code

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to check the current firmware version and OTA update status through the web interface, so that I can manage firmware updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/ota/version, THE Web_Server SHALL respond with the current firmware version string
2. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/ota/version, THE Web_Server SHALL include the build date in the response
3. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/ota/version, THE Web_Server SHALL include the ESP-IDF version in the response
4. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/ota/version, THE Web_Server SHALL include available storage space for OTA updates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to retrieve comprehensive system information through the web interface, so that I can monitor device health and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/system/info, THE Web_Server SHALL respond with a JSON object containing chip model information
2. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/system/info, THE Web_Server SHALL include the number of CPU cores in the response
3. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/system/info, THE Web_Server SHALL include CPU frequency in the response
4. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/system/info, THE Web_Server SHALL include flash size information in the response
5. WHEN a GET request is sent to /api/system/info, THE Web_Server SHALL include MAC address in the response
