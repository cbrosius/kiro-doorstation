# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Theme Toggle feature implements a light/dark theme toggle for the ESP32 SIP Door Station web interface, allowing users to switch between color schemes based on their preference or ambient lighting conditions. The theme preference is persisted in browser local storage and automatically applied on subsequent visits.
