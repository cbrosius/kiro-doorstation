# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Configuration Backup/Restore feature enables system administrators to backup and restore all device configuration settings through the web interface. It provides a safety mechanism for configuration migration between devices, recovery from configuration errors, and maintaining configuration snapshots for disaster recovery.

## Glossary

- **System**: The ESP32 SIP Door Station configuration management system
- **Configuration_Backup**: A JSON file containing all device settings
- **Configuration_Restore**: The process of applying settings from a backup file
- **NVS**: Non-Volatile Storage where configuration is persisted
- **Factory_Reset**: Complete erasure of all configuration returning to default state
- **Configuration_Validation**: Verification that backup data is valid and compatible

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Configuration Backup Generation

7. IF validation fails, THEN THE System SHALL return detailed error messages indicating which fields are invalid

### Requirement 4: Configuration Restore Process

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to restore configuration from a backup file, so that I can recover from configuration errors or migrate settings to a new device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator uploads a configuration file, THE System SHALL validate the configuration
2. WHEN validation succeeds, THE System SHALL display a preview of the configuration
3. WHEN the administrator confirms restore, THE System SHALL backup current configuration for rollback
4. WHEN backup is complete, THE System SHALL write new configuration to NVS
5. WHEN NVS write succeeds, THE System SHALL commit the changes
6. WHEN restore completes, THE System SHALL return success status
7. IF restore fails, THEN THE System SHALL rollback to the previous configuration

### Requirement 5: Configuration Preview

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to preview configuration before applying it, so that I can verify the settings are correct before making changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator uploads a configuration file, THE System SHALL parse and validate the JSON
2. WHEN validation succeeds, THE System SHALL display formatted configuration data
3. WHEN preview is displayed, THE System SHALL show WiFi SSID, SIP server, NTP server, and DTMF settings
4. WHEN preview is displayed, THE System SHALL mask password fields
5. WHEN preview is displayed, THE System SHALL provide "Apply" and "Cancel" buttons

### Requirement 6: Factory Reset Functionality

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform a factory reset, so that I can return the device to default settings when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE administrator requests factory reset, THE System SHALL display a confirmation dialog
2. WHEN confirmation is provided, THE System SHALL erase all configuration from NVS
3. WHEN NVS is erased, THE System SHALL restart the device
4. WHEN device restarts, THE System SHALL initialize with default configuration
5. WHEN factory reset completes, THE System SHALL return to AP mode for initial setup

### Requirement 7: Configuration Metadata

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configuration backups to include metadata, so that I can identify when and from which device a backup was created.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System generates a backup, THE System SHALL include configuration format version number
2. WHEN backup is generated, THE System SHALL include current timestamp in ISO 8601 format
3. WHEN backup is generated, THE System SHALL include firmware version string
4. WHEN backup is generated, THE System SHALL include device model identifier
5. WHEN restoring, THE System SHALL check version compatibility and warn if mismatch detected

### Requirement 8: Rollback on Restore Failure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic rollback if configuration restore fails, so that the device remains functional even if restore encounters errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE System begins restore, THE System SHALL save current configuration to temporary storage
2. WHEN restore process fails, THE System SHALL restore configuration from temporary storage
3. WHEN rollback completes, THE System SHALL return error message indicating restore failure
4. WHEN rollback succeeds, THE System SHALL verify device functionality
5. IF rollback fails, THEN THE System SHALL log critical error and attempt factory reset

### Requirement 9: Web Interface Backup/Restore Section

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a dedicated web interface section for backup and restore, so that I can easily manage configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN THE web interface loads, THE System SHALL display configuration management section
2. WHEN section is displayed, THE System SHALL show current firmware version and last modified date
3. WHEN section is displayed, THE System SHALL provide "Download Backup" button
4. WHEN section is displayed, THE System SHALL provide file upload interface for restore
5. WHEN section is displayed, THE System SHALL provide "Factory Reset" button
6. WHEN section is displayed, THE System SHALL provide checkbox for password inclusion option

### Requirement 10: API Endpoints for Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want RESTful API endpoints for configuration management, so that the web interface can perform backup, restore, and validation operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria
