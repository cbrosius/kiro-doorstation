# Tasks to Implement Multicolor LED State Display on ESP32-S3

## Overview
Implement control of the integrated WS2812B RGB LED connected to GPIO48 on the ESP32-S3 development board using esp-idf. The LED will indicate the current state of the device by changing color or blinking patterns.

---

## Implementation Summary

### Hardware Configuration
- **LED Type**: WS2812B RGB LED (addressable RGB LED)
- **GPIO Pin**: GPIO48 (data pin for WS2812B protocol)
- **Control Method**: RMT (Remote Control) peripheral for precise timing
- **esp-idf** Version:5.5.x rmt_tx lib

### Device State to LED Mapping

Init: Yellow blinking
WiFi Connecting: Blue fast blink
WiFi Connected: Green solid
SIP Connecting: Orange slow blink
SIP Registered: Green solid
Call Incoming/Outgoing: Magenta fast blink
Call Active: Red solid
Error: Red fast blink
Connected: Green pulsing (breathing effect)


### Files Created/Modified

#### New Files
- `main/led_handler.h` - LED control module header
- `main/led_handler.c` - LED control module implementation

#### Modified Files
- `main/CMakeLists.txt` - Added led_handler.c to build
- `main/main.c` - Added LED initialization and state updates
- `main/sip_client.c` - Added LED state updates on SIP events

### LED Control Module API

```c
// Initialization
esp_err_t led_handler_init(void);

// State management
void led_handler_set_state(led_state_t state);
led_state_t led_handler_get_current_state(void);

// Direct control
void led_handler_set_color(uint8_t red, uint8_t green, uint8_t blue);
void led_handler_set_pattern(led_pattern_t pattern);

// Update (call periodically for patterns)
void led_handler_update(void);
```

### Integration Points

1. **Main.c**: LED initialization and boot sequence state updates
2. **SIP Client**: State updates on registration, calls, and errors
3. **Main Loop**: Periodic LED pattern updates (every 100ms)

### LED Patterns Supported

- **Solid**: Steady color
- **Slow Blink**: 1 Hz blinking
- **Fast Blink**: 2 Hz blinking
- **Pulse**: Breathing effect (2-second cycle)
- **Off**: LED turned off

## Task Completion Status

- [ ] Analyze ESP32-S3 LED hardware and GPIO48 configuration for multicolor LED control.
- [ ] Setup GPIO48 as output in esp-idf project, ensure correct configuration.
- [ ] Create a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) module for the LED control with initialization and color/pattern functions.
- [ ] Define device states that require LED indication (Initialization, Network Connected, Call Active, Error State, Idle).
- [ ] Map each device state to a specific LED color or blinking pattern.
- [ ] Implement state change detection in the device's main logic or state machine to trigger LED updates.
- [ ] Integrate calls to LED control functions on state changes.
- [ ] Test LED patterns for all defined device states on the physical ESP32-S3 board.
- [ ] Debug and fine-tune LED timing and colors as needed.
- [ ] Document the LED control module usage and device state to LED mapping for future maintainability.

## Testing Instructions

1. Build the project with ESP-IDF
2. Flash to ESP32-S3 board with WS2812B LED on GPIO48
3. Observe LED behavior during:
   - Device boot (yellow blinking)
   - WiFi connection (blue fast blink → green solid)
   - SIP registration (orange slow blink → green solid)
   - Incoming calls (magenta fast blink)
   - Active calls (red solid)
   - Error conditions (red fast blink)

## Future Enhancements

- Add configurable LED brightness levels
- Implement custom color schemes via web interface
- Add LED test patterns for hardware validation
- Support for multiple WS2812B LEDs in a strip
